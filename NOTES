couldn't find mesh variable id FlowMesh

=> add code to search for cf_role=='mesh_topology' DONE

Old code depended on some key variables -
 vol_var: used to figure out cell_dim, layer_dim

Hmm - probably have to shift to more variable driven. So we scan the variables,
building up meshes as needed to support the variables encountered.

Made some progress - in theory should be able to display the 2D mesh, but
it's getting a segfault.
