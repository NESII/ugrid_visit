DFM output (nc output, not the UGRID option)


NetNode_z is working, displayed in 2D grid
FlowElemDomain: okay
numlimdt properly shows up with time.
s1 good (surface)


Mesh2D.LayCoord_cc: doesn't include proper vertical.



sa1: No go.  Error is that zonal variable has 0 values, should have 33830.


Dealing with sigma coordinates: 
  Does it make sense for 3D MeshInfo with sigma coordinates to retain a reference (?!)
  to eta and bedlevel VarInfo?

  Can't really hold on to reference to variable.
  But MeshInfo (and VarInfo for that matter) could have a reference/pointer back to 
  avtUGRIDFileFormat


TODO:

 Make a vector variable out of the various component variables.
