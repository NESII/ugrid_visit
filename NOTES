DFM output (nc output, not the UGRID option)

couldn't find mesh variable id FlowMesh

=> add code to search for cf_role=='mesh_topology' DONE

Old code depended on some key variables -
 vol_var: used to figure out cell_dim, layer_dim

Hmm - probably have to shift to more variable driven. So we scan the variables,
building up meshes as needed to support the variables encountered.

Made some progress - in theory should be able to display the 2D mesh, but
it's getting a segfault.


Loads/displays the Mesh2D.nodes mesh okay.
But segfaults one the 2D grid.

 - gets to the end of GetMesh - then no other info, and seg fault.

 - valgrind --trace-children=yes visit...
   tons of tons of output.
   possibly segfault from  vtkCellLinks

 one issue is that I've been assuming start_index=0, but it's a start_index=1 file.
 also should pay attention to fill value.
 Fixed - fill_value is already handled, and obeying start_index for face_node_connectivity
 solves the seg fault.  Now displays the 2D grid!


NetNode_z should be working, but isn't...

Dealing with sigma coordinates: 
  Does it make sense for 3D MeshInfo with sigma coordinates to retain a reference (?!)
  to eta and bedlevel VarInfo?

  Can't really hold on to reference to variable.
  But MeshInfo (and VarInfo for that matter) could have a reference/pointer back to 
  avtUGRIDFileFormat
